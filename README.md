Currently, it has only a few programs that it recognizes, and every part of it is still under testing, as well as being far away from an official release since it only has basic functions at the moment. 

Current features include:
- programs are recognized if installed
- programs open when selected
- programs split in categories
- functioning searchbar
- functioning favorites button (puts programs on top of the list)

Work-in-progress:
- group and start apps together

Future ideas:
- order programs by usage
  - let user choose how to order the programs
- section containing only favorites
- let user add programs to the list
- interface alternatives
  - widget
  - menu bar
